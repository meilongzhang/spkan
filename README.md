# spkan - Sparse Convolutions with Kolmogorov-Arnold Network
### Introducing Sparse Convolutional KANs
This project extends the idea of the innovative architecture of Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) to sparse convolutions.

### Credits
This repository builds upon an implementation of Convolutional-KANs which is available [here](https://github.com/AntonioTepsich/Convolutional-KANs).
This repository uses an efficient implementation of KAN which is available [here](https://github.com/Blealtan/efficient-kan).
The original implementation of KAN is available [here](https://github.com/KindXiaoming/pykan). 
The original paper of the KAN is available [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.19756).
